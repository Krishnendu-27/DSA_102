# 🚀 DSA_102: The Ultimate DSA Journey in C & C++

Welcome to **DSA_102**, where I take on the challenge to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in **120 days**!  
My mission: Learn C, then C++, and solve **1000+ DSA questions by the end of 2025**.  
This repo is my public learning diary, resource hub, and solution bank—open for everyone who’s passionate about DSA!

## 👋 About Me

Hey! I’m **Krishnendu**, a developer determined to conquer DSA.  
- I started with C, then moved to C++, and now I’m deep-diving into classic and advanced DSA topics.
- Inspired by the legendary **Coder Army - Rohit Negi**, I’m following his comprehensive C++ DSA course and solving curated sheets.

## 🎯 Repo Goals

- **Learn & Share:** Document my learning journey, notes, solutions, and homework.
- **Practice:** Tackle at least 1000 DSA questions by the end of 2025.
- **Track Progress:** Mark dates and milestones as I complete topics and problems.
- **Help Others:** Make my notes and code accessible to fellow learners.
